About the Project
-----------------
My Network Lunchbox project (originally I was going to name it palantir) aims to provide a ready-to-use image for Soekris net4801 (and possibly 4501) to make them usable as general-purpose network troubleshooting devices. Specifically, the intent is enable administrators of large, complex or geographically dispersed networks to be able to install a Soekris device with one interface on a network reachable from their workstation and use the other two interfaces as entry points into unreachable or problematic networks.
